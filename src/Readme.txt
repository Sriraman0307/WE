On Execution, the "Simulation" class gets executed first and it instantiates the other three classes.
The number of Re-samples is accepted as the input from the user during run time.

Since the number of bins is fixed (4 in this case) and the initial weight is known to be 1, no other input is required.

Example inputs: 
Enter the number of re-samples:
4
Enter the number of re-samples:
3
Enter the number of re-samples:
5

Refer to the sample outputs for verification.
